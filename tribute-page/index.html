                <h2>Social Life</h2>
                <p>Soewardi was born into Javanese aristocracy, his family belonged to the royal house of Pakualaman. He
                was one of Prince Paku Alam III's grandsons through his father, GPH Soerjaningrat. Thanks to his
                family's priyayi (Javanese nobility) background, he was able to access the colonial public education, a
                luxury that was unattainable by most of common population in the Indies. He graduated from basic
                education in ELS (Dutch Primary School). Then he continued his study at STOVIA, a medical school for
                native students. However, he failed to graduate because of illness.
                Later he worked as a journalist and wrote for many newspapers, including Sediotomo, Midden Java, De
                Expres, Oetoesan Indies, Kaoem Moeda, Tjahaja Timoer and Poesara. He was also a contributor to
                Kebangoenan, a nationalist newspaper owned by the Dutch-educated jurist and politician Phoa Liong
                Gie.During Soewardi's career in printed media, he was considered a talented and accomplished writer.
                His style of writing is popular, communicative and yet imbued with idealism for freedom and
                anti-colonialist sentiment.</p>

                <h2>Political Movement</h2>
                <p>Besides being a tenacious young reporter, Soewardi was also active in social and political
                organizations. Since the establishment of Boedi Oetomo in 1908, he was active in their propaganda
                service to socialize and promote public awareness of Indonesia as a national unity (especially in Java).
                He also organized Boedi Oetomo's first congress in Yogyakarta.
                Young Soewardi was also a member of the Insulinde, a multi-ethnic organization that was dominated by
                Indo activists. This organization was advocating for self-rule in the Dutch East Indies. One of the
                prominent figures in this organization was Ernest Douwes Dekker. Later, Soewardi was invited to join the
                party, when Douwes Dekker established the Indische Partij.
                Ki Hadjar Dewantara has coined a famous proverb to describe his educational ideals. Rendered in
                Javanese, the maxim reads: Ing ngarso sung tulodo, ing madyo mangun karso, tut wuri handayani. Which
                translates: <i>"(for those) in front should set an example, (for those) in the middle should raise the
                spirit, and (for those) behind should give encouragement".</i> The proverb is used as the principle of Taman
                Siswa. Today, part of this maxim, Tut Wuri Handayani is used as the motto of Indonesian Ministry of
                Education. It was meant to describe ideal teachers, who after transmitting knowledge to their students,
                would stand behind their students and give them encouragements in their quest for knowledge.</p>

                <h2>Honours</h2>
                <p>Ki Hajar Dewantara advocates that education should be made possible and available for all people,
                regardless of their sex, race, ethnicity, culture, religion, economic and social status, etc. He argued
                that education should be based on the values of common humanity, human freedom and the rights to seek
                knowledge.
                Ki Hajar Dewantara's birthday is now celebrated as Indonesian National Education Day. He is also
                credited for having coined the motto; Tut Wuri Handayani, today used by the ministry of education. An
                Indonesian navy training ship, KRI Ki Hajar Dewantara, bears his name in honor. His portrait
                immortalizes him in the 20,000 rupiah banknote denomination in 1998.</p>
